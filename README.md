This project basically provides a bridge between a 3D model and IoT solutions.

Values from the sensors are reflected in dynamic ways in the 3D model of various spaces sucshas as data centers, warehouse, production units and many more.

Its just an interactive and user friendly approach to show the real time data from IoT sensors.
